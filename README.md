# MAN - Mad Accessible Network

👋 Welcome to MAN, the Mad Accessible Network! With MAN, you can easily create random SQL databases that fit your needs. Just select the fields you want and let MAN generate the creation script for you.

## Features

✅ Easy to use: Just select the fields you want and MAN will do the rest.

🔥 Randomness: MAN uses a sophisticated algorithm to generate random data that is both realistic and unexpected.

🤖 Automation: Create as many databases as you want with just a few clicks.

👨‍💻 Open source: MAN is free and open source, so you can use it for any purpose.

## Getting started

To use MAN, you'll need at least Java 8 installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website.

Once you have Java installed, you can download the MAN JAR file from the MAN GitHub repository. Simply download the latest release and save the JAR file to a convenient location on your computer.

To run MAN, open up a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the JAR file. Then, type the following command:

`java -jar man.jar`

This will launch MAN and you can follow the prompts to select the fields you want and generate your SQL database.

That's it! You're now ready to start using MAN to create your own custom SQL databases. If you have any questions or issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to us on the MAN GitHub repository.

## Examples

Here are some examples of the kind of databases you can create with MAN:

🎓 Student database: Create a database of students with fields like name, age, major, and GPA.

🚗 Car database: Create a database of cars with fields like make, model, year, and price.
